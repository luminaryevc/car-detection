# Car Detection

This project demonstrates car detection using computer vision techniques. It uses image processing algorithms to detect and track cars in images or video streams.

## Features

- Car detection in images or video streams
- Highlighting detected cars with bounding boxes
- Displaying the number of cars detected

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV (for image processing and computer vision)
- Haar cascades (for car detection)

## Getting Started

To run the car detection project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

      git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-detection.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:

      cd car-detection
   

3. Install the required dependencies:

      pip install opencv-python
   

4. Run the car detection script:

      python car_detection.py
   

5. The script will prompt you to provide an image or video file path. Enter the path to the file you want to process.

6. The script will process the file and display the output with detected cars highlighted.

## Customization

You can customize the project by modifying the following files:

- car_detection.py: Update the car detection algorithm and add additional functionalities.
- haarcascade_car.xml: Replace the Haar cascade XML file with a different trained cascade for car detection.
